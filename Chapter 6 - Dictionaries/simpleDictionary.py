#A dictionary in python is a built in datatype that stores key value pairs


#Consider a game featuring aliens that can have different colors and point values
#This simple dictionary stores information about a paticular alien

alien_0 = {"Color": "Green", "Points": 5}

print(alien_0)

#A key value pair is a set of values associated with each other

#alien_0 = {"Color": "Green"}
#This dictionary stores one peice of info about alien_0
#The Alien's color is the key and the value is "Green"


#Adding new key value pairs
alien_0["X_Pos"] = 0
alien_0["Y_Pos"] = 25

print(alien_0)

#You can also have lists of dictionaries ima skip that for now but it seems very cool
#For example you can have a list of aliens all with different colors and data
